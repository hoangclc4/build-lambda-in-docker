# Build Lambda in Docker

## Quick Start

```shell
npm run package
```

And find `function.zip` ready to be uploaded to AWS Lambda.

Example uses [sharp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sharp) package to show case, TypeScript and Webpack, however, it's not required and only used for illustration purposes.
